            <h1>Introduction to Human Genetics and Heredity</h1>
            <p>Human genetics is study of the inheritance of characteristics by children from parents. Inheritance in humans does not differ in any fundamental way from that in other organisms. It is a fascinating field that explores the inheritance of traits and characteristics in humans. <br><br>It encompasses various branches, such as classical genetics, molecular genetics, cytogenetics, and genomics. By studying human genetics, scientists can gain valuable insights into the genetic basis of human traits, diseases, and the overall complexity of our genetic makeup.</p>

            <h1>Heredity</h1>
            <p>Heredity refers to the passing of traits from parents to their offspring. It is through heredity that we inherit our physical characteristics, such as eye color, hair color, and height, as well as our susceptibility to certain diseases.<br><br>Heredity is governed by genes and its alleles, which are segments of DNA that contain instructions for building and maintaining our bodies.</p>

            <h1>Genes and Alleles</h1>
            <p>At the core of heredity are genes, which are segments of DNA that contain the instructions for building and maintaining our bodies. <br><br>Genes come in pairs, with one copy inherited from each parent. Each gene has different versions called alleles. For example, the gene responsible for eye color may have alleles for blue, brown, or green eyes. The combination of alleles inherited from both parents determines the specific trait expression in an individual.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="aaaa" id="dnr">
            <h1>Dominant and Recessive Traits</h1>
            <p>Some traits are governed by dominant and recessive alleles. Dominant alleles are expressed when present, even if only one copy is inherited. On the other hand, recessive alleles are only expressed when two copies are inherited, one from each parent.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Punnett_Square_%28Green_Dominant%29.svg/800px-Punnett_Square_%28Green_Dominant%29.svg.png"></p>
            
            <p>For example, if a person inherits a dominant allele for brown eyes from one parent and a recessive allele for blue eyes from the other parent, they will have brown eyes because the dominant allele overrides the recessive allele.</p>
            
            <p>To predict the probability of inheriting certain traits, scientists use Punnett squares. Punnett squares are a visual tool that helps determine the possible combinations of alleles that offspring can inherit from their parents. By crossing the alleles of both parents, the Punnett square can show the likelihood of different trait outcomes in their offspring.</p>

            <h1>Genetic Disorders</h1>

            <p>Genetic disorders are conditions caused by abnormalities or mutations in our genes. They can be inherited from one or both parents or arise spontaneously due to mutations in our own DNA.<br><br>Examples of genetic disorders include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Down syndrome, and Huntington's disease. Understanding human genetics and heredity is crucial for diagnosing and treating these disorders.</p>

            <p>Heredity is the process by which traits and characteristics are passed down from parents to their offspring through genes. It involves the transmission of genetic information, the interaction of alleles, and the expression of dominant and recessive traits.<br><br>Heredity is a complex and fascinating field that helps us understand the diversity and variation within species, the inheritance of genetic disorders, and the mechanisms behind the traits that make each individual unique.</p>
